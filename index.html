					<h2>The New Digital Landscape</h2>
					<p>Large-scale changes to the digital landscape have impacted every aspect of how brands communicate with consumers. Tactics that worked well as recently as 2013 to organically reach a large audience have become obsolete. Audiences are increasingly using mobile platforms social media platforms are racing to monetize their platform and content marketing has permeated the industry. The maturation of social media has caused a fundamental reset in the digital landscape.</p>

  				</div>

				<h4>Consumers no longer live online or offline, they just live</h4>

				<p>The platforms connecting people to each other, and mediums connecting people to content, are being fundamentally reengineered to capture attention on mobile, tablet and emerging platforms.</p>

				<h4>Responsive isn’t a nice to have</h4>
				<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Laudantium, fuga sequi minima quae eos doloremque vitae necessitatibus voluptatum consequuntur quibusdam? Aut, quaerat, amet animi possimus non vel nobis dolor itaque.</p>

				<h4>Facebook is now your Social TV</h4>
				<p>Facebook’s latest move toward a downward trend of organic reach in favor of paid promotion has created a seismic change in the industry. Tactics that worked well as recently as 2013 to organically reach a large audience have become obsolete as Facebook has updated its algorithm to reduce organic reach to around 1 percent. This means when a brand posts to Facebook, only about 1 percent of people who have already liked the brand will see the post without paid promotion.</p>

				<h4>The Social Media Landscape is fragmented</h4>
				<p>As the social giants (Facebook and Twitter) have updated their platforms, niche social networks have begun to provide incredible value to their communities. The stratification of social networks can be complicated and intimidating but will also provide a sizable opportunity for agencies that are ready to create differentiated content streams.</p>

				<h4>Everyone is a Brand Publisher now</h4>
				<p>The concept of brand has been constantly changing. What started as a pursuit focused on the development of logos and marks has become the ongoing definition and redefinition of what a brand means as it’s expressed across multiple channels, in real-time. The concept of branding is now being expressed through multiple touch points from day-to-day community management to responsive content marketing programs. As more and more agencies embrace content marketing programs we are beginning to see a storytelling arms race, creating an influx of content in an already crowded space. The concept of brands as publishers is no longer an academic axiom, it’s now a brand imperative.</p>

					<h2>The New Creative Landscape</h2>
					<p>The changes to the digital landscape have transformed how we have to address creative. The sudden rise of content marketing programs has created a content arms race that makes the importance of engaging and agile creative more important than ever. And as social media marketing has gone from an experimental tactic to a full-fledged discipline, the importance of data-driven initiatives with a heavy emphasis on paid media has become a vital component of modern communications.</p>

  				</div>

				<h4>We’ve never produced so much content before.</h4>

				<p>$118.4 billion will be spent on content marketing, video marketing, and social media in 2013 (eMarketer) and 9 in 10 companies are now marketing with content  (Content Marketing Institute). This has produced an unprecedented amount of content, in an already crowded marketplace. And the trends are only increasing. 55% of B2C marketers plan to increase content marketing spend next year. (Content Marketing Institute).</p>

				<h4>The feedback loop has never been so fast</h4>
				<p>From the moment creative goes online we receive instantaneous, and continuous feedback. The speed and volume of feedback results in a faster iteration cycle.</p>

				<h4>There has never been so many demands for different types of content</h4>
				<p>As the social giants  Facebook and Twitter have begun to monetize their platforms niche social networks have begun to provide incredible value to their communities. The stratification of social networks is leading to higher differentiated content that is produced exclusively for a channel.</p>

				<h4>And we have to do all of this… with less resources</h4>
				<p>Clients expect agility and resourcefulness. A TV spot is no longer just about creating one video, it’s about developing a suite of content pieces that will live on social channels. The real strategic and process challenge will be developing high quality content faster and more frequently than we’ve ever done.</p>

				<h4>Creating an Agile Creative Process</h4>

				<h5>Ideation</h5>
				<p>Good ideas can come from anywhere. Look for a wide array of creative solutions to fit your problem.</p>

				<h5>Production Process</h5>
				<p>Do process and creative live together? They have to. Having the right mindset, client and legal frameworks in place that allow you to quickly develop content is essential to an agile system.</p>

				<h5>Fail Quickly</h5>
				<p>Test creative in the wild and use immediate feedback and data to form hypothesis on how to adjust the direction.</p>

				<h5>And we have to do all of this… with less resources</h5>
				<p>Clients expect agility and resourcefulness. A TV spot is no longer just about creating one video, it’s about developing a suite of content pieces that will live on social channels. The real strategic and process challenge will be developing high quality content faster and more frequently than we’ve ever done.</p>

				<h4>Set Creative Standards, not a Hierarchy</h4>
				<p>Agile teams need to understand the benchmarks for creativity but how they get there should be up to them. Copywriters can come up with concepts and designers can write copy. The old siloed systems of creative need to be broken down and rebuilt with a distributed model.</p>

				<h4>Old Model</h4>
				<p>TBD</p>

				<h4>New Model</h4>
				<p>TBD</p>

				<h4>Create a team that can create good content, not a style of content</h4>
				<p>Creative teams will need to be nimble enough to develop small lightweight content as well as produce heavier anchor pieces. Creative teams will have to wear many hats and be able to play in multiple creative arenas. Creative process will be key in the ability to quickly iterate and shift direction. Without a clear process in place creative teams will go back to old, slower forms of concepting which won’t work in today’s landscape. </p>

				<h4>Experiment like a mad scientist</h4>
				<p>There the only secret ingredient to content marketing is it’s constant evolution. Agile teams will need to experiment with style tone and channel, relentlessly testing and retesting in the pursuit of better understanding our audience.</p>

				<h4>Break down silos like your job depends on it… because it does</h4>
				<p>The only way to survive in today’s creative landscape is to ensure that your teams are in constant communication. Analytics teams need direct input into the creative teams. Community managers need to have input over strategic decisions. Digital doesn’t exist in silos, neither can can your team.</p>

				<h4>Don’t develop creative without a paid plan</h4>
				<p>We used to say that the line between advertising and content is blurring. That line is now vanished. On most platforms there is functionally no difference between a great ad and a great piece of content. People don’t care whether something is an ad or not – if the content is high quality and authentic, that’s all that matters. Erasing the line between content and advertising means there are efficiencies to be gained by bringing the two operations together. Integrating content creation, paid strategy, and paid placement can create efficiencies that impact a brand’s ability to play in a real-time space.</p>
